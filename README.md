This is an experimental component of Papeeria which is responsible for storing file edit history. Its main functions are as follows:

* Keep N latest revisions of every stored text file 
* Record changes made by users in the process of file editing
* Replay the sequence of edits starting from some particular revision with an option to reject some of the edits
* Provide "suggestion mode" which allows for one editor to edit his own copy of file with the purpose of mergind the changes into the master copy afterwards.

This project was started in March 2018 as a term practice work of the students of Saint-Petersburg Academic University.
